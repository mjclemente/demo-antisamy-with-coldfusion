Bill, couldn't make it to the Museum's <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">story time</span>
today, he was so busy shoveling! Well, we sure missed you Bill! So since ou were busy moving snow we read books about
snow. We found a clue in one book which revealed a snowplow at the end of the story - we wish it had driven to your
driveway Bill. We also read a story which shared fourteen <em>Names For Snow. </em>We'll catch up with you next
week....wonder which hat Bill will wear?<br />Jane
